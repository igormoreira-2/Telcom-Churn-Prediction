# Telcom-Churn-Prediction
Using Machine Learning for Churn Prediction

Customer churn rate has always been a key performance indicator for many industries including Telcom and Digital Media companies. Given the direct effects on revenue and marketing spend, these businesses are constantly looking for ways to predict customers who are likely to churn, or in other words, "leave the company". It is widely known by industry experts that the cost of retaining an existing customer is far less than acquiring a new one, thus the reason for increased focus on retention rates. Additional revenue streams can be realized if companies are able to predict customers likely to leave them. Over the past years, there has been a growing adoption of Machine Learning predictive algorithms that can identify customers more likely to churn. In this article, I will be using a Telcom dataset downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/vhcg77/telcom-churns-dataset) and go over the general steps involved in developing a prototype Churn Prediction model using industry-standard binary classification algorithms. The structure of this project can be seen below:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Data Preparation (Feature Engineering)
3. Modelling (Scikit-Learn, CatBoost, and XGBoost)
4. Final Results
